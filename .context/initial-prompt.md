# Design Prompt for Figma

## Prompt 1

I'm creating a simple 2-3 page application called "The Assigning Stick". The idea is we list jersey numbers a group of middle school kids can select for their upcoming lacrosse season. They will select up-to 3 number options & include their desired size. Then be assigned a jersey number when all kids have made their selections.

The Color pallet should be simple:
- Navy Blue for the primary color.
- Powder Blue for the secondary color.
- White, Black, & Gray as accent colors as needed.
- Any other colors to create the background will be fine.

Page 1: The public facing page should include a list of all jersey numbers available to the team. Display them on Powder blue jerseys with navy numbers with white outlines. We'd need a call to action for a player to submit their options. They're names will be selectable from a pre built list. Following their submission will be a notification telling them Coach is waiting for X number of players to respond & Assignments will be posted by February 1, 2026.

Page 2: The admin page. The admin will need to be able to input a roster with basic information - first, last name, grade, are they a returning player, did they participate in fall ball. After the list is inputted, they need to be able to see who from that list has made their submissions. Then they need a CTA to kick off the automated number assignment. They'll be able to preview the results & suggest manual edits before finalizing thing.

Page 3: Once the admin finalizes things, a public roster with names and jersey numbers should be present. Let's use the same jersey option with their name and assigned number displayed.

Overall, the concpet is there.
